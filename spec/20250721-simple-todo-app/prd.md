# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Simple Todo Web App

## Introduction/Overview

This project aims to build a minimalist personal todo management application using Vite + React + TypeScript. The application focuses on providing the most basic and essential features, allowing users to quickly record and manage daily todos without complex setup or learning curves.

## Objectives

1. Provide a simple and intuitive interface that users can start using within 5 seconds
2. Ensure all todo data is safely stored in the local browser
3. Achieve zero-latency user interaction experience
4. Keep the code clean and easy to maintain and understand

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to add todos so that I can record tasks that need to be completed
2. As a user, I want to mark todos as complete so that I can track my progress
3. As a user, I want to delete todos so that I can remove tasks that are no longer needed
4. As a user, I want to see my previous todos after reopening the browser so that I can continue tracking tasks

## Functional Requirements

1. **Add Todo Items**
   - The system must provide an input field for users to enter todo content
   - The system must add the todo to the list when the user presses Enter or clicks the add button
   - The system must clear the input field after adding
   - The system must not allow adding empty todos

2. **Display Todo List**
   - The system must display all todos in a list format
   - The system must show content and status (completed/incomplete) for each todo
   - The system must visually distinguish between completed and incomplete items (e.g., strikethrough)

3. **Mark Completion Status**
   - The system must provide a checkbox or clickable area for each todo
   - The system must allow users to toggle the completion status of todos
   - The system must immediately update the visual presentation to reflect status changes

4. **Delete Todo Items**
   - The system must provide a delete button or option for each todo
   - The system must permanently remove the todo after user confirmation
   - The system must immediately update the list display

5. **Data Persistence**
   - The system must use browser localStorage to store all todos
   - The system must automatically read and display stored todos on page load
   - The system must automatically save after each data change

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Multi-user support or user authentication
- Todo editing functionality (can only delete and re-add)
- Categories, tags, or priority features
- Due dates or reminder features
- Search, filter, or sort functionality
- Data export/import features
- Theme switching or custom styling
- Mobile optimization or PWA features
- Backend API or cloud sync

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Recommendations
- **Style**: Adopt minimalist design to reduce visual distractions
- **Color Scheme**: Use neutral colors (black, white, gray) with one accent color
- **Font**: Use system default fonts to ensure cross-platform consistency
- **Layout**:
  - Top: Application title
  - Upper middle: Input area (input field + add button)
  - Lower middle: Todo list
  - Maintain appropriate whitespace and spacing

### Interaction Design
- All operations should have immediate visual feedback
- Delete operations may include simple confirmation mechanism (e.g., double-click to delete)
- Support keyboard operations (Enter to add, Tab navigation)

## Technical Considerations

1. **Framework Choice**: Use Vite + React + TypeScript
2. **State Management**:
   - Use React's `useState` Hook to manage todo list
   - Use `useEffect` Hook to handle localStorage read and write
   - No need for Redux or other complex state management solutions
3. **Component Architecture**:
   - `App.tsx`: Main application component
   - `TodoInput.tsx`: Input component for adding todos
   - `TodoList.tsx`: Component for displaying todo list
   - `TodoItem.tsx`: Component for individual todo items
4. **Styling Solution**: Use simple CSS Modules or inline styles
5. **Data Structure**:
   ```typescript
   interface Todo {
     id: string;
     text: string;
     completed: boolean;
     createdAt: number;
   }
   ```
6. **localStorage key**: Use clear naming like `simple-todo-items`

## Success Metrics

1. Works properly on Chrome browser
2. All basic features completed (add, delete, mark complete)
3. Data correctly saved to localStorage

## Open Questions

1. Should pagination or virtual scrolling be added when todos reach a certain quantity?
2. Should delete operations require confirmation or provide undo functionality?
3. Should todo creation time be displayed?
4. What's the handling strategy when localStorage reaches capacity limit?
